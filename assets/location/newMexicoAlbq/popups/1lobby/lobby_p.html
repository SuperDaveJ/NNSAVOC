  <p>Numerous and varied food options exist within walking distance of each location. Whatever your dining need, from easy and quick, to sit-down and relax, chances are it’s only a short walk away. Within walking distance, the Bowling Center has a large café called the Sparetime Grill. It offers a large variety of items such as hamburgers, hotdogs, pizza, green chile stew, and many daily specials. <br /><br />
Also on base is the Bogey Bar and Grill located at the Tijeras Arroyo Golf Course. You will need a vehicle, however, to travel the 3 or 4 miles to the golf course.
