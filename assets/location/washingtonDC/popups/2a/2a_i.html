<div id="scroll">
  <p>The Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) is a retirement system for certain Federal employees. It was replaced by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) for Federal employees who first entered covered service on and after January 1, 1987. <br />
    <br />
The CSRS is a defined benefit, contributory retirement system.&nbsp; Employees share in the expense of the annuities to which they become entitled. You may contribute 7%, 7.5% or 8% of your pay to CSRS.Â  The NNSA matches your CSRS contributions, percentage for percentage.
