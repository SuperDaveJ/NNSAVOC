  <p>The Livermore Laboratory Employees Services Administration (LLESA) provides an opportunity for employees to focus on their job knowing their children are being well cared for and nurtured by an exceptional teaching staff. 
Accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the Children's Center provides year-round child development services for infants, toddlers, preschool, and elementary school age children of LLNL, DOE/NNSA, Sandia Lab, and LLNL Contract employees.<br /><br />
The program's curriculum supports learning and growth through developmental based hands-on play experiences within a social atmosphere.<br /><br />
Located approximately 1 mile away from the Laboratory, the Children's Center's proximity allows parents to visit their children at any time during the day. The Children's Center has given parents peace of mind allowing them to fulfill their work responsibilities with less worry, anxiety, and distraction. <br /><br />
