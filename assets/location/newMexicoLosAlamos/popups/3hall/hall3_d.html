      <p>The National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) program is a Homeland Security Council and National Security Council-sponsored policy initiative that uses data from forensic analysis of a sample or device to identify, among other things, the source of the sample or device and the persons or groups responsible for its use in planned or actual acts of terrorism. <br />
        <br />
        This initiative assigns NNSA the following responsibilities:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li>Develop and sustain pre-detonation nuclear device forensics operational concept of operations and associated capabilities</li>
            <li>Take physical custody of recovered nuclear explosive devices</li>
            <li>Support the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov" target="_blank">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) in the collection of materials samples and other forensics data from such devices</li>
          </ul>
       
    <p>Establish and maintain a domestic post-detonation ground debris collection capability to determine where the device or materials originated</p>
