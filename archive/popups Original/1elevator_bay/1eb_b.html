<div id="scroll">
  <p>The U.S. Government&rsquo;s Nuclear Incident Response Teams reside within NNSA&rsquo;s Office of Emergency Operations.  These teams maintain the Nation&rsquo;s capability to respond to a nuclear or radiological incident or emergency anywhere in the world.  They are the Nation&rsquo;s last line of defense.  <br />
    <br />
Nuclear Incident Response Teams are maintained in a state of readiness to meet the requirement for their deployment within hours of notification to search for, locate, and manage a nuclear or radiological incident, anywhere in the world.  No other Federal department or private institution has a similar capability.  
These teams support and work with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p> </div>
