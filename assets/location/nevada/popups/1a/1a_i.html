  <p>The Office of Public  Affairs (OPA) provides the public and the news media with clear, accurate, and  complete information about NRC programs, policy decisions, and activities. They  do this primarily by issuing news releases and distributing Commission  speeches, fact sheets, and brochures.   The office follows news coverage of the agency, and responds to media  and public inquiries.  Should a serious  event occur with one of the NRC's licensees, OPA would also provide immediate  crisis communication support, including, if appropriate, implementing the  Emergency Event web page.</p>
