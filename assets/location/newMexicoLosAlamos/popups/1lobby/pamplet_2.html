  <p>The NNSA Los Alamos Site Office has piggy backed on the Los Alamos National Laboratory Health Services Working with the Laboratoryâ€™s Occupational Medicine Health and Fitness programs.  A variety of cardiovascular, muscle conditioning, yoga, and stretch/relaxation classes are available to eligible personnel.<br /><br />
<strong>Eligibility:</strong><br /><br />
Exercise classes require authorized access for participants to use the Wellness Center exercise facility.  Exercise classes are restricted to employees of Los Alamos Security, LLC (LANL), DOE direct employees, Pro-Force SOC-LA, LACFD, and specified contractor/affiliates.<br /><br />
<strong>Exercise Class Policies:</strong><br /><br />
Please read the Exercise Class Policies prior to taking a class.  The class policies explain the class requirements, class levels, and cancellations.<br /><br />
Exercise classes are offered free of charge to all eligible Wellness Center customers, no registration required.  Due to room capacity requirements, there is a strict 30-student maximum per class unless otherwise noted in the brochure.  Classes fill on a first-come, first-served basis and participants will secure their space by signing the class roster each time they come in to attend a class.
