<div id="scroll">
  <p>Each year the Department of Energy participates in Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day by inviting employees to bring children, ages 8-18, to work with them to participate in an enriching educational experience.    <br />
    <br />
Designed to be more than a career day, the program goes beyond the average &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; an adult.  Exposing girls and boys to what a parent does during the work day is important, but showing them the value of their education; helping them discover the power and possibilities associated with a balanced work and family life; and, providing them an opportunity to share how they envision the future and begin steps toward their end goals in a hands-on and interactive environment is key to their achieving success. <br />
<br />
Each year, the Department plans speakers, events and hand-on activities designed to show kids the fun side of science and engineering in everyday life.</p>
