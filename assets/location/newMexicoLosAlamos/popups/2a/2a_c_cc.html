  <p>Hi, Carol.  I&rsquo;m calling you back with some information about the Military Payback Deposits benefit.  The NNSA offers this benefit for employees who have performed active military service after December 31, 1956, that may be creditable for retirement purposes.  These payback deposits are tied to people employed in a position subject to the Civil Service Retirement System before October 1, 1982, and/or those covered under the Federal Employees Retirement System after January 1, 1987.  I&rsquo;ll advise anyone who&rsquo;s interested in finding out more about this benefit to visit me or any other HR representative. Bye!</p>
