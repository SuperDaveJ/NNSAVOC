<div id="scroll">
  <p>New Federal employees are automatically enrolled in  the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).   FERS is a retirement plan that provides benefits from three different  sources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Social Security Benefits (OASDI and Medicare)</li>
    <li>Basic Benefit Plan</li>
    <li>Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Social Security and the TSP can go with you to your next job if you leave  the Federal Government before retirement.   The NNSA withholds the cost of the Basic Benefit and Social Security from  your pay as pre-tax deductions.&nbsp; To be eligible to receive retirement  benefits from the Basic Benefit plan if you leave Federal service before  retiring, you must have at least 5 years of creditable civilian service.</p>
