  <p>Family friendly leave is another reason the NRC  is rated the best place to work in the Federal Government.  The term “family friendly leave” encompasses  many situations.  It includes the  opportunity to be present for the birth or adoption of a child, provide health  care for a family member, or attend the funeral of a family member.  More specific information is available at the  leave kiosk in the second floor elevator bay.</p>
