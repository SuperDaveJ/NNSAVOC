  <p>If you are looking for ways to help those in need in your community and beyond, there are lots of opportunities at the NNSA. Did you know that the Combined Federal Campaign is the most inclusive workplace charitable giving campaign in the world with the number of participating charities estimated at over 20,000 nonprofit charitable organizations worldwide? The charities supported through the CFC range from nascent community groups to large, well-known charities.  The campaign season runs from September 1 through December 15 each year.  During this time, employees can designate contribution amounts, may designate specific charitable organizations, and may even elect to have automatic payroll deductions. </p>
