  <p>At the NNSA, we take our national security mission very seriously. NNSA is working with our partners to strengthen the capability of foreign governments to deter, detect, and interdict illicit trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive materials across international borders and through the global maritime shipping system. NNSA works collaboratively with foreign partners to equip border crossings, airports and seaports with radiation detection equipment. NNSA also provides training in the use of the systems for appropriate law enforcement officials and initial system sustainability support as the host government assumes operational responsibility for the equipment.</p>
