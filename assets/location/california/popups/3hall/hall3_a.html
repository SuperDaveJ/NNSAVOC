  <p>The NNSA&rsquo;s Office of Defense Programs offers a suite of activities to enhance collaboration between NNSA&rsquo;s eight sites and the U.S. Military/Service Academies.<br />
These programs are administered at NNSA and executed at NNSA sites, including the labs, production facilities, and the Nevada National Security Site. At each location, leading-edge research and development is carried out on key national security technologies critical to the United States and its allies.
  <br />
  <br />
  Programs include science, technology, and engineering essential to sustaining the nation&rsquo;s arsenal of nuclear weapons, plus a wide array of work on other efforts for the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, among others, plus support to the Intelligence Community.</p>
