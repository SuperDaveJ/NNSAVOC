   <p> The Subsidy for Energy      Employees&rsquo; Transit (SEET) program is designed to promote the use of public      transportation to conserve energy resources and ease traffic congestion.      DOE employees may enroll in the SEET program to receive a monthly transit      subsidy that can be used to help offset the commuting cost of getting to      and from work. Many regional transit providers accept fare media from the      SEET program. <br /><br />
  Eligibility for participation in SEET is limited to DOE Federal employees not listed on a Federal parking permit; members of a vanpool (not to include the driver); and certain other employees who may be on temporary assignments to the Agency. Applicants must certify that the benefit will be used for commuting purposes only and that the monthly transit subsidy received does not exceed the actual average monthly commuting costs. </p>
