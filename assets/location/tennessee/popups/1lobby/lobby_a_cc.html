<p>Welcome to the NNSA Vitual Orientation Center (VOC).<br />
  <br />
  Congratulations on your new employment with the NNSA, a great place to work with an exciting and important national security mission. You probably have a number of questions as you begin your journey. Let&rsquo;s start with this question: How can you learn more about the NNSA before you arrive? That&rsquo;s exactly what the VOC is designed to do.<br />
  <br />
  You&rsquo;ll find that the VOC has three floors, and each floor has one or more rooms. Use your mouse or the arrow keys to move around an area. Use the elevator to move from one floor to another. The rooms, hallways, lobby, and elevator all contain information for you.<br />
  <br />
  You can use the directory near the elevator on each floor to help you decide where you want to go or you can just explore on your own.<br />
  <br />
  As you look around the VOC, a plus sign will appear on the screen when you rollover an item that is selectable. You can also use the tab key when you&rsquo;re in a room to move from one selectable item to the next. Select the indicated items to access the information available. Some items that pop up have additional information that you can get to by selecting the highlighted text. <br />
  <br />
  A Site Map can be accessed through the Automated Assistant at the bottom left of your screen, which allows you to jump to rooms within the VOC.<br />
  <br />
  You may access information in any order, and at any time you wish. It&rsquo;s not necessary to complete your tour of the VOC in one sitting. If you need to leave, close the website and come back later. Be sure to visit each floor, each room, and explore every available interaction. You may want to start by viewing the NNSA Administrator&rsquo;s Welcome Message to your left.<br /><br />
Enjoy looking around, and welcome to the NNSA. </p></div>
