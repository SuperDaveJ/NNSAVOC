  <p>Hi!  Carol asked me to stop  by and tell you about the National Treasury Employees Union, or NTEU.  The NTEU is widely known as a smart, tough  organization.  It’s well-respected for  its knowledge of Federal employee issues as well as its determination to work  with Federal agencies, Congress, and the courts to protect, promote, and expand  the rights of those it represents.  </p>
  <p>For 70 years, the NTEU has been driven  by the principle that every Federal employee should be treated with dignity and  respect.  NTEU represents over 150,000  bargaining unit employees in 31 Federal agencies and departments.  </p>
  <p>NTEU members are  represented by an experienced and professional staff in Washington, D.C.,  seven field offices across the nation, and highly trained, dedicated, local  leaders in their workplaces.</p>
