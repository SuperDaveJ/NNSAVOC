  <p>At the discretion of NNSA, the repayment of all or parts of qualifying student loans may be provided to recruit highly qualified candidates for initial Federal appointment to positions determined to be difficult to fill. Employees receiving loan repayment incur a service obligation. </p>
  <p>Current Federal employees are not eligible for an initial student loan repayment. Candidates who will serve under time limited appointments of less than 3 years and Schedule C appointees are also excluded from receiving student loan repayments.<br />
    <br />
