  <p>The NRC is led by five Commissioners, who are  appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  Each Commissioner serves a five-year  term.  One Commissioner is designated by  the President to be the Chairman and official spokesperson of the Commission.  </p>
  <p>The  Chairman is the principal executive officer of NRC. As such, he is responsible  for conducting the administrative, organizational, and long-range planning,  budgetary, and some personnel functions of the agency.  </p>
  <p>The Chairman has ultimate authority for all  NRC functions pertaining to an emergency involving a facility licensed by the  NRC.  The Chairman operates within the  general policies of the Commission.</p>
  <p> The Commission formulates policies, develops  regulations governing nuclear reactor and nuclear material safety, issues  orders to licensees, and adjudicates legal matters.</p>
  <p>Go ahead and look around the room if you’d like.  Each place setting has more information about  a specific Commissioner.</p>
