  <p>As  a Federal employee you are eligible to elect Federal Employee Health Benefit  (FEHB) coverage, unless your position is excluded by law or regulation.  You must return all enrollment forms to HR  within 60 calendar days of your first day of employment.  After the forms have been received, and a  full pay period has passed, your medical benefits will be effective.  Your medical benefits are deducted using  pre-tax dollars.</p>
  <p> What  about changing your benefits?  They may  be changed during open season, which is mid-November to mid-December each year. </p>
  <p>You may have questions about plans and coverage  (limits, co-pays, deductibles, network locations, out of network costs,  etc.).  There are several plans available  to you, and you can read about each plan and their specific details at <a href="http://opm.gov/insure/" target="_blank">http://opm.gov/insure/</a>.</p>
