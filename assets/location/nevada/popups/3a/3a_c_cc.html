  <p>Hi, I’m your virtual HR Specialist, and I’m here to tell you what will happen on your first day at the NNSA.  Prior to your first day, you will receive details regarding when your first day is, as well as the time and location of where you should report
Once you’re in the building, a representative from the Office of Human Resources will escort you to the orientation and security briefing.  The orientation session will include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Badge and paperwork completion</li>
	<li>Oath of Office and Welcome to NNSA</li>
	<li>Personnel Security briefing</li>
	<li>Benefits briefing</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the orientation will cover payroll, work hours, building safety, and parking and transportation information.
After orientation, your office contact will meet you and take you on a tour of the office.  Your supervisor will also meet with you and briefly introduce you to the staff in your work unit.<br /><br />
Please remember to bring your direct deposit information (voided check) and two forms of identification.  The first ID must be a valid picture ID issued by a state or by the Federal government.  The second may be any document from List A, B, or C on Form I-9.  A list of those items is on the table.  You are required to present the original documents on your first day of employment.<br /><br />
You will receive access to the NNSA computer network and telephone systems.  Included with this access will be passwords for your computer and network access, telephone voice mail, the Time and Attendance System, and Employee Self Service.
Orientation at the NNSA continues after your first day.  During this year, you will have various opportunities to learn more about NNSA and to network with other new employees.  NNSA offers an orientation several times a year to provide new employees insight to their role in reaching NNSA’s mission as well as hearing from senior leaders at NNSA. As you complete the orientation, be sure you have completed all the proper forms and returned them.  Please use the document entitled NEW HIRE CHECKLIST for more specific information.  A copy of the checklist is located on the table if you wish to access that information now.<br /><br />
Depending on your office, there may be a training or qualification process designed to provide you with the information, knowledge, and skills you need to be successful in your position.  There will be someone to assist you with these activities.
