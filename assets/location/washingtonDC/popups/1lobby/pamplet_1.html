  <p>NNSA Headquarters operates National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) accredited child development centers at its Forrestal and Germantown facilities. Each center provides day care services that accommodate up to 70 children ranging in age from 6 weeks through 6 years. <br />
    <br />
    The centers are open from 7:15 a.m. until 6:15 p.m. Monday through Friday. Parental visits are encouraged, as well as visits from those searching for a child care facility. Priority placement and a tuition assistance program are available to DOE employees. <br />
    <br />
    If you have elected the Flexible Spending Account (FSA) option as a benefit, you may use that account for some or all of your Energy Child Development Center expenses. For more information, visit the links below.<br />
