<div id="scroll">
  <p>The Federal Employee Dental and Vision Insurance Program  (FEDVIP) is available to eligible employees and their eligible family  members.  If you are eligible for FEHB,  then you’re eligible for FEDVIP.  You do  not need to be enrolled in an FEHB plan to participate in FEDVIP. Premiums are withheld on a pretax  basis. </p>
  <p>Enrollment is completed  online and should be finished within 60 days of your first day on the job.  You have three choices in your enrollment: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-only</li>
    <li>Self plus one</li>
    <li>Self and family</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have enrolled, your enrollment continues automatically  from year to year.  Changes to coverage  can be made during the annual open season (November/December). In addition,  changes can be made in the event of a valid qualifying life event.  You may cancel only during open season.</p>
  <p> You  may have questions about the specifics of each plan (limits, co-pays,  deductible, network locations, out of network costs, etc.).  Because there are several plans available to  you, and the coverage varies from one plan to another, it is best to review  each plan’s details carefully.  Plan  information can be found at: <a href="http://opm.gov/insure/" target="_blank">http://opm.gov/insure/</a>.</p>
