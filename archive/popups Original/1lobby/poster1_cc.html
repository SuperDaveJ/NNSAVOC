<div id="scroll">
<p>We must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon. This is the most immediate and extreme threat to global security. <br />
  <br />
The work we do here is dynamic and interesting. No two countries in which we work are alike. Each relationship, whether it&rsquo;s with an international partner or within the U.S. in our agency is unique and often challenging. <br />
<br />
Due to nuclear terrorism being a real threat, my work ensures that the United States is ready to respond to any terrorist or non-terrorist incident and at any time. <br />
<br />
By working at NNSA, I work globally securing radiological and nuclear material.<br />
<br />
The work our office funds directly contributes to the modernization of the NNSA&rsquo;s physical infrastructure, and without a modern physical infrastructure, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to continue the stewardship of the stockpile and our other nuclear security mission. <br />
<br />
The most rewarding part of my job is knowing that I make a positive contribution to national security. <br />
<br />
Enhancing the surety of our nation&rsquo;s nuclear weapons is essential to the country&rsquo;s security. <br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s one of the great things about my job â€“ you never know what to expect each day. <br />
<br />
And we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe. To protect our people, we must act with a sense of purpose without delay. </p>
