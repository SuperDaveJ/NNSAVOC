   <p> The purpose of the SRS Employee Association (SRSEA) is to plan, sponsor, and promote cultural, athletic, social and recreational events designed to improve the morale and camaraderie of the participants. The SRSEA's primary focus will be on employee/retiree services in four key areas: self, family, work, and community.<br /><br />

The events will be conducted to inspire an atmosphere of teamwork, friendliness, and good sportsmanship between the employees, the Savannah River Site and the communities where the employees live.<br /><br />

The SRS Employee Association is a not-for-profit organization; thereby, participants (not members) can benefit from discounts within the community, purchase merchandise from the on-site gift store, and participate in events sponsored by the association.
