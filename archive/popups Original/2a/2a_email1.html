  <p>All NNSA employees automatically receive basic Federal Employee Group Life Insurance (FEGLI).&nbsp; Through payroll deduction, employees may elect to increase the basic coverage and/or add family coverage.&nbsp; After the first day on the job, they have 31 days to elect additional coverage.&nbsp; After this initial election, they cannot increase coverage, but they may decrease it at any time.&nbsp; If coverage is waived by the end of the first pay period, no premiums will be deducted.<br />
    <br />
    Although open enrollment periods do occur, they are rare.&nbsp; If an employee decides to waive the insurance, but changes his mind later, he must wait one year and provide medical information before applying.&nbsp; Certain specified coverage may be added within 60 days of a qualifying life event (marriage, divorce, death of a spouse, or birth or adoption of a child). <br />
