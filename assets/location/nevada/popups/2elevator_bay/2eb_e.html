  <p>NNSA has designed and implemented performance-based compensation systems that provide the flexibilities needed to maintain a competitive edge in the market place by offering higher entry salaries as well as faster pay progression for high-performing employees. Salary tables for the compensation system that covers the majority of NNSA employees are listed <strong><a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/2011%20DEMO%20Salary%20Tables.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></strong><a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/2011%20DEMO%20Salary%20Tables.pdf">.</a><br />
    <br />
Certain difficult-to-fill scientific and technical positions are recruited through a different performance-based compensation system. This system&rsquo;s salary tables are listed <strong><a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/Difficult%20to%20fill%20scientific%20and%20technical%20pay%20charts%2005-24-2010-rev.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></strong><a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/sites/default/files/nnsa/inlinefiles/Difficult%20to%20fill%20scientific%20and%20technical%20pay%20charts%2005-24-2010-rev.pdf">.</a><br />
<br />
NNSA&rsquo;s Senior Executive Service (SES) employees are compensated through a third performance-based compensation system. See the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's<a href="https://www.opm.gov/oca/10tables/html/es.asp" target="_blank"> <strong>SES salary tables</strong>.</a><br />
<br />
Paychecks are deposited biweekly. To streamline the paycheck process, your paycheck must be deposited via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to your bank account.  You may choose to have your EFT routed to more than one account.  For example, you may choose to have 80% of your paycheck deposited in your checking account, 10% into a personal savings account, and 10% into a college fund, or other special savings account.  In addition, you may purchase Savings Bonds.<br /><br />
You must provide tax withholding forms in accordance with applicable Federal and state laws. If you have questions, you may contact the DOE&rsquo;s Payroll office.<br />
<br />
Last, but not least, as an NNSA employee, you will get 10 paid Federal holidays each year.  The list of holidays for each year is published on <strong><a href="http://www.opm.gov" target="_blank">OPM&rsquo;s website</a></strong>.  <br /><br />
You will also be able to access all of your pay and leave information on <strong><a href="http://mis.doe.gov/ess" target="_blank">DOE&rsquo;s Employee Self Service</a></strong>. </p>
