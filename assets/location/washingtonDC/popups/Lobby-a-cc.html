  <p><strong>[Lobby Receptionist Avatar  (female)]</strong>  </p>
  <p>Welcome to the NRC Virtual Orientation Center  (VOC).  Please take a moment to enter  your name, and some basic information, then we’ll get started.</p>
  <p>Congratulations on  your new employment with the NRC, one of the best places to work in the Federal  Government! You probably have a number of questions as you begin your  journey.  Let’s start with this question:  How can you learn more about the NRC before you arrive?  That is exactly what the VOC is designed to  do.</p>
  <p>You will find that  the VOC has three floors, and each floor has one or more rooms.  The rooms, hallways, lobby, and elevator all  contain information for you.  You may  access this information in any order, and at any time you wish. It is not  necessary to complete your tour of the Orientation Center in one sitting.  If you need to leave, simply log off and come  back later.  Be sure to visit each floor,  each room, and explore every available interaction. Each interaction will give  you the essentials about the topic.  In  many cases you will find links to sites where you can get more information.</p>
  <p>Use  the arrow keys to move forward, turn around, or turn to the left or right.  As your avatar turns, you will see the room  move, just as you do when you move your head, or turn your body in a  non-virtual environment.  Use the  elevator to move from one floor to another.   Again, it is not necessary to move through the VOC in order.  You will find a directory by the elevator on each  floor.  As you look around the VOC, use  it to help you decide where you want to go next.</p>
  <p> If  you have any questions, the Automated Assistant can be accessed by clicking on  the icon in the lower left-hand corner.</p>
  <p>That should do it for now.  Enjoy looking around, and welcome to the NRC!</p>
