<div id="scroll">
  <p>The <strong><a href="http://www.tsp.gov" target="_blank">TSP</a></strong> is a tax-deferred savings plan similar to a 401(k) plan. Your TSP account will automatically be set up when you become an NNSA employee. NNSA will deposit an amount equal to 1 percent of the basic pay you earn each pay period into your TSP account whether you contribute or not. You can make optional contributions up to the limit set by the Internal Revenue Service for the current year. The first 3% of pay that you contribute will be matched dollar-for dollar; the next 2% will be matched at 50 cents per dollar.<br />
    <br />
The NNSA deposits into your account 1% of your basic pay each pay period. &nbsp;<br />
You have a choice of investment funds. Investments are automatically sent to the G Fund until you select other options.<br />
Other important benefits of the TSP are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Catch-up contributions for participants age 50 or older</li>
    <li>A loan program that allows participants access to the money in their accounts</li>
    <li>In-service withdrawals for financial hardship or after age 59 Â½</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The ability to transfer money from other eligible retirement plans into your TSP account</p></div>
