   <p> A number of DOE/NNSA federal employees have expressed an interest in a transit subsidy in New Mexico. As a result, the NNSA Albuquerque Complex has established a Transit Subsidy Benefit Program, which started on October 1, 2007. <br /><br />
This program is designed to promote the use of public transportation to conserve energy resources and ease traffic congestion. Federal employees may enroll in the program to receive a monthly transit subsidy benefit in the form of a bus pass or rail commuter check (i.e., a voucher) that can be used to help offset the commuting costs of getting to and from work. <br /><br />
Recent changes in the IRS Code increased the maximum monthly transit subsidy to $245. The actual amount is dependent upon what types of mass transit are available and the employee's actual cost of using public transportation to commute to and from work. For example, if an employee rides the bus to and from work and the cost is $20 per month that would be the employee's maximum transit subsidy benefit, not the $245. <br /><br />
Eligibility for participation in this pilot transit subsidy program is limited to:<br />
<ul><li>DOE/NNSA Federal Employees not listed on a Federal parking permit</li>
<li>Applicants who certify that the benefit will be used for commuting purposes only and that the monthly transit subsidy received does not exceed their actual average monthly commuting costs for public transit</li></ul></p><p>
Federal employees enrolled in the benefit program will be notified by email when bus passes or commuter checks will be distributed for the month.
Federal employees participate on the honor system, and lost passes will NOT be covered.
To enroll in the transit subsidy benefit program, submit a completed and signed application to your applicable Transit Subsidy Program Coordinator.
