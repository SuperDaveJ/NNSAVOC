      <p>Did you know that DOE is a major supporter of the use of electric vehicles and the stations required to re-charge their batteries? These cars reduce dependence on foreign petroleum, have zero emissions, are less expensive to run than gasoline or diesel vehicles, and have the ability to be charged at home or at a charging station. </p>
      <p>If you own an electric vehicle, then you are in luck!  For a small flat fee, charging stations are available at Forrestal and Germantown.  The charging stations accommodate vehicles requiring a three-prong 120 VAC electrical outlet.  Two additional 220 VAC electrical outlets are available for use at Forrestal when not needed by the Department&rsquo;s own fleet of electric vehicles.  <br />
