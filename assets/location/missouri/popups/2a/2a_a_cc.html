  <p>Welcome to the Human Resources office!  As an NNSA employee, you have access to many benefits; Medical, Dental, Vision, Long-term Care, Flexible Spending Accounts, Federal Employees Group Life Insurance, and Retirement, just to name just a few.<br />
    <br />
You&rsquo;ve come by at a really good time.  I have some e-mails with updated information about the Federal Employee Group Life Insurance and benefits that you will want to take a look at.  Also, I just received a voicemail about the Military Payback Deposits benefit.<br />
<br />

Please make yourself at home, and look around the room.  If you see something you&rsquo;d like to know more about, simply click on that item. </p></div>
