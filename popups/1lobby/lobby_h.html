  <p>If  you like to travel, there are many opportunities to do so.&nbsp; The NRC has  multiple offices in multiple locations.&nbsp; Also, the NRC divides the United States  into four regions, with a main office in each region.&nbsp; Depending on your  job, you may be traveling to construction, medical, or research sites.&nbsp; In  some cases, you may be needed to travel internationally to represent the NRC.</p>
