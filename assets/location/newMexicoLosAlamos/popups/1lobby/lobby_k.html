  <p>The NRC maintains a state-of-the-art fitness  center in the headquarters building complex at Two White Flint North, on the 1st  floor.  You will find a complete  selection of equipment, including bikes, treadmills, and weights.  In addition, nutritional and health programs  are sponsored by the Fitness Center during lunch periods.  A one-time initial fee of $25 gets you  started.  After that, biweekly payroll  deductions keep you on your workout schedule.</p>
