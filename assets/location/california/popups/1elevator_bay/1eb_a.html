      <p>The Office of Defense Programs uses some of the fastest supercomputers in the world through its Advanced Simulation &amp; Computing (ASC) program at its national laboratories.  These supercomputers run simulations to ensure the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nuclear stockpile while maintaining the moratorium on underground nuclear explosive testing.  <br />
        <br />
        ASC tools also play an important role in supporting nonproliferation efforts, emergency response, and nuclear forensics. <br />
        <br />
  Beyond nuclear-related uses, scientists use supercomputers for a diverse range of other applications, such as researching AIDS vaccinations or modeling global climate change.  Supercomputers are a critical part of NNSA, answering questions that have long eluded scientists all while keeping the country safe and secure.  </p>
