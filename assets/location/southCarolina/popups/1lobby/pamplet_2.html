  <p>Each SRS employee is eligible for the health-fitness program and is responsible for obtaining his/her own membership in an approved Health-Fitness Organization. Employees must fulfill the terms of an "annual membership" in an approved Health-Fitness Organization in order to qualify for the annual membership reimbursement-allowance. <br /><br />
Reimbursement is contingent upon the employee's utilization of the Health-Fitness Organizations facilities on a regular and ongoing basis (i.e., approximately once a week, at least 52 times in a calendar year). Minor exceptions are permitted for things such as travel, vacation, and extended illness. <br /><br />
The employee must file a Reimbursement Voucher for Employee Fitness Program on an annual basis upon completion of each membership year with the DOE-SR Finance Division to receive the annual membership reimbursement-allowance established by the DOE-SRS Wellness Committee. 
Employee must attach to the Reimbursement Voucher for Employee Fitness Program the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A statement signed by the management of the Health-Fitness Organization attended confirming the health-fitness organization's full compliance with the Vendor (Health-Fitness Organization) Approval Criteria and the amount of annual membership dues you paid allocable to your self-only membership for the completed membership year. </li>
	<li>A copy of his/her Health-Fitness Organization contract (showing period of membership). </li>
 </ul>
<p>Employees must file their annual claim for reimbursement (i.e., the Reimbursement Voucher for Employee Fitness Program) within three months after completion of the employee's membership year to qualify for the reimbursement-allowance.   
Groups of DOE-SRS employees that wish to join the same health-fitness organization may consider negotiating as a unit to obtain group rates, which tend to be less expensive.
