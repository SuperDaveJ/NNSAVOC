  <p><strong>Family Friendly Leave</strong><br /><br />
Family friendly leave is one reason the NNSA is a great place to work in the Federal Government.  The term &ldquo;family friendly leave&rdquo; encompasses many situations.  It includes the opportunity to be present for the birth or adoption of a child, provide health care for a family member, or attend the funeral of a family member.  More specific information is available at the leave kiosk in the second floor elevator bay.<br /><br />
